# Credits and Refund-as-Credit System - Implementation Guide

## Overview

This document describes the comprehensive account credits system that has been implemented for the sonography clinic platform. The system supports manual credit issuance, refund-as-credit workflows, automatic credit application at checkout, expiry management, and full audit trail tracking.

---

## ✅ What Has Been Implemented

### 1. Type System (types.ts)

**New Types Added** (lines 357-418):

- **`AccountCredit`**: Full-featured credit with:
  - Remaining balance tracking
  - Source tracking (manual, refund, win-back, etc.)
  - Category restrictions (all, services only, products only, packages only)
  - Max per-order limits
  - Expiry dates
  - Active/inactive status
  - Reason codes

- **`CreditLedgerEntry`**: Immutable audit trail for all credit actions:
  - Action types: issued, applied, expired, revoked, adjusted
  - Balance before/after
  - Timestamp and performer tracking
  - Links to appointments and refunds

- **`RefundTransaction`**: Complete refund workflow tracking:
  - Full or partial refunds
  - Credit vs original payment method
  - Reason categories (cancellation, no-show, service issue, etc.)
  - Status tracking (pending, processed, cancelled)
  - Linkage to original appointment and issued credit

- **`CustomerCreditBalance`**: Aggregated balance view showing:
  - Total credits issued
  - Available credits
  - Redeemed credits
  - Expired credits
  - Credits expiring soon

### 2. Credit Utilities (utils/credits.ts)

**Core Functions Implemented**:

```typescript
// Issue new credit
issueCredit(patientName, amount, source, reasonCode, description, options)

// Validate credit eligibility
validateCreditForPurchase(credit, purchaseContext)

// Calculate applicable amount
calculateApplicableCredit(credit, totalAmount)

// Apply credit and create ledger entry
applyCredit(credit, amountToApply, appointmentId, ledger, performedBy)

// Expire/revoke/adjust credits
expireCredit(credit, ledger)
revokeCredit(credit, reason, performedBy, ledger)
adjustCredit(credit, adjustmentAmount, reason, performedBy, ledger)

// Calculate customer balance
calculateCustomerBalance(patientName, credits)

// Get available credits (sorted by expiry)
getAvailableCredits(patientName, credits)

// Process refund as credit
processRefundAsCredit(appointment, refundAmount, reason, reasonCategory, processedBy, options)

// Auto-apply at checkout
autoApplyCredits(patientName, totalAmount, purchaseContext, availableCredits)
```

**Key Features**:
- ✅ Automatic expiry checking
- ✅ Category-based eligibility validation
- ✅ Max per-order enforcement
- ✅ Smart credit prioritization (expiring soonest first)
- ✅ Partial credit application support
- ✅ Full ledger entry creation for all actions
- ✅ Round to 2 decimal places for currency

### 3. Storage Layer (utils/storage.ts)

**New Storage Functions** (lines 268-329):

```typescript
// Account Credits
saveAccountCredits(credits: AccountCredit[])
loadAccountCredits(): AccountCredit[]

// Credit Ledger
saveCreditLedger(ledger: CreditLedgerEntry[])
loadCreditLedger(): CreditLedgerEntry[]

// Refund Transactions
saveRefundTransactions(refunds: RefundTransaction[])
loadRefundTransactions(): RefundTransaction[]
```

**Storage Keys**:
- `sonorecall_account_credits`
- `sonorecall_credit_ledger`
- `sonorecall_refund_transactions`

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Credit Lifecycle

```
1. ISSUANCE
   ├─ Manual (admin)
   ├─ Refund (appointment cancellation)
   ├─ Programmatic (win-back, challenge refund, etc.)
   └─ Creates ledger entry with "issued" action

2. APPLICATION
   ├─ Auto-apply at checkout (highest priority)
   ├─ Manual toggle to save for later
   ├─ Partial application supported
   ├─ Updates remainingAmount
   └─ Creates ledger entry with "applied" action

3. EXPIRATION
   ├─ System checks expiry dates
   ├─ Marks credit as inactive
   ├─ Sets remainingAmount to 0
   └─ Creates ledger entry with "expired" action

4. REVOCATION/ADJUSTMENT
   ├─ Admin can revoke or adjust
   ├─ Requires reason
   └─ Creates ledger entry with "revoked" or "adjusted" action
```

### Data Flow

```
Customer Books Appointment
  ↓
System Checks Available Credits
  ↓
Validates Eligibility (expiry, category, limits)
  ↓
Calculates Applicable Amount
  ↓
Auto-Applies Credits (unless customer opts out)
  ↓
Updates Credit Balances
  ↓
Creates Ledger Entries
  ↓
Saves Appointment with Applied Credits
```

### Refund-as-Credit Flow

```
Admin Initiates Refund
  ↓
Selects Refund Method: Credit or Original Payment
  ↓
IF Credit:
  ├─ Creates AccountCredit
  ├─ Creates RefundTransaction (links to credit)
  ├─ Creates Ledger Entry ("issued" from refund)
  ├─ Links to Original Appointment
  └─ Optionally sets expiry date
```

## 🔌 Integration Points

### 1. App.tsx State Additions

```typescript
const [accountCredits, setAccountCredits] = useState<AccountCredit[]>([]);
const [creditLedger, setCreditLedger] = useState<CreditLedgerEntry[]>([]);
const [refundTransactions, setRefundTransactions] = useState<RefundTransaction[]>([]);

// Load on mount
useEffect(() => {
  const loaded = loadAccountCredits();
  setAccountCredits(loaded);
  setCreditLedger(loadCreditLedger());
  setRefundTransactions(loadRefundTransactions());
}, []);

// Save on changes
useEffect(() => {
  saveAccountCredits(accountCredits);
}, [accountCredits]);

useEffect(() => {
  saveCreditLedger(creditLedger);
}, [creditLedger]);

useEffect(() => {
  saveRefundTransactions(refundTransactions);
}, [refundTransactions]);
```

### 2. BookingModal Integration

```typescript
// In BookingModal component

import { autoApplyCredits, applyCredit } from '../utils/credits';

// State
const [useCredits, setUseCredits] = useState(true);
const [appliedCredits, setAppliedCredits] = useState<Array<{credit: AccountCredit, amount: number}>>([]);

// Calculate available credits
const availableCredits = getAvailableCredits(patientName, accountCredits);
const balance = calculateCustomerBalance(patientName, accountCredits);

// Auto-apply calculation
useEffect(() => {
  if (useCredits && cartSubtotal > 0) {
    const result = autoApplyCredits(
      patientName,
      cartSubtotal,
      {
        hasServices: !!selectedService,
        hasProducts: selectedProducts.size > 0,
        hasPackages: selectedBundles.length > 0
      },
      availableCredits
    );
    setAppliedCredits(result.creditsToApply);
  } else {
    setAppliedCredits([]);
  }
}, [useCredits, cartSubtotal, selectedService, selectedProducts, selectedBundles]);

// On booking confirmation
const handleBooking = () => {
  // ... existing booking logic ...

  // Apply credits and create ledger entries
  const updatedCredits = [...accountCredits];
  const newLedgerEntries = [...creditLedger];

  appliedCredits.forEach(({ credit, amount }) => {
    const { updatedCredit, ledgerEntry } = applyCredit(
      credit,
      amount,
      newAppointment.id,
      newLedgerEntries,
      'customer'
    );

    const index = updatedCredits.findIndex(c => c.id === credit.id);
    if (index >= 0) {
      updatedCredits[index] = updatedCredit;
    }
    newLedgerEntries.push(ledgerEntry);
  });

  setAccountCredits(updatedCredits);
  setCreditLedger(newLedgerEntries);

  // Save applied credits to appointment
  newAppointment.appliedAccountCredits = appliedCredits.map(c => ({
    creditId: c.credit.id,
    amount: c.amount
  }));
};
```

### 3. Appointment Cancellation / Refund

```typescript
const handleRefundAsCredit = (
  appointment: Appointment,
  refundAmount: number,
  reason: string,
  reasonCategory: RefundTransaction['reasonCategory'],
  expiryDays?: number
) => {
  const { credit, refund, ledgerEntry } = processRefundAsCredit(
    appointment,
    refundAmount,
    reason,
    reasonCategory,
    'Admin User', // Replace with actual user
    { expiryDays }
  );

  // Add to state
  setAccountCredits(prev => [...prev, credit]);
  setRefundTransactions(prev => [...prev, refund]);
  setCreditLedger(prev => [...prev, ledgerEntry]);

  // Update appointment status
  setUpcomingAppointments(prev =>
    prev.map(apt =>
      apt.id === appointment.id
        ? { ...apt, status: 'Cancelled', refundId: refund.id }
        : apt
    )
  );

  // Show confirmation
  setNotification({
    message: `Refund processed: £${refundAmount.toFixed(2)} credited to ${appointment.patientName}`,
    type: 'success'
  });
};
```

---

## 📝 Notes

- All monetary amounts stored as numbers (not strings)
- Timestamps in ISO 8601 format
- Credits sorted by expiry (FIFO for equal expiry)
- Ledger is append-only (never delete entries)
- Balance calculations always from ledger
- Refund transactions immutable once processed
- Consider adding customer ID system in future for better data integrity

---

## 🔐 Security Considerations

- Validate refund amounts <= original appointment total
- Require reason for all manual adjustments
- Log all admin actions with performer name
- Prevent negative credit balances
- Validate expiry dates are in future
- Sanitize reason/note text inputs
- Rate limit refund processing

---
