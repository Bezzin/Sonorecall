Applying Alex Hormozi’s $100M Money Models to
Our Clinic App
Alex Hormozi’s “$100M Money Models” playbook is all about getting customers to spend more, faster,
and repeatedly. It provides a framework to maximize each customer’s value through a sequence of offers
– ensuring a customer generates more profit in the first 30 days than it cost to acquire them . The
goal is a self-funding business loop where new customers quickly pay for themselves and finance the next
customers . By baking these monetization techniques into our clinic-focused app, we can help clinics
dramatically boost revenue, improve cash flow, and scale sustainably. Below we break down every relevant
strategy from the book and map out how our app can implement them for clinics.
Core Principle: The 30-Day Profit Rule and Money Model Ethos
Hormozi’s core metric for a healthy business is 30-day gross profit > 2× (Customer Acquisition Cost + Cost of
Delivery) . In simple terms, each customer’s first month should yield enough profit to cover
acquiring that customer (and then some). This removes cash as a growth bottleneck. Businesses that
achieve this have “functionally impossible to kill” cash flow – they can reinvest immediately into getting
more clients without running dry.
Solve Customer Problems, Get Paid – The Money Model philosophy is to continually identify
problems or needs the customer has at every step and offer a paid solution . “If a problem appears,
and you can solve it immediately – in exchange for money – do it!” Hormozi says . This means beyond
the initial service, clinics should be ready to offer additional value (for a fee) whenever it helps the
patient.
Exponential Growth via More, Faster, Again – By getting customers to spend more (higher value
per visit), faster (less time between purchases), and again and again (repeat visits/subscriptions),
the revenue impact compounds. Hormozi notes that doubling each of these levers can lead to 8×
growth (2×2×2) . Our app will focus on all three levers – increasing transaction size, purchase
frequency, and customer retention.
“100 Ways to Offer” Mindset – Importantly, Hormozi stresses that you don’t necessarily need
dozens of different products or services – you need creative ways to package or present offers .
“It’s less about having 100 products to offer, and more about having 100 ways to offer your product.” .
This is great for clinics: we can help them repurpose their core services into various attractive offers
without adding overhead (even leveraging partner products if needed).
With this ethos in mind, Hormozi’s framework boils down to four core offer types that drive monetization.
His most successful businesses use all four in combination . We’ll explain each type and then show how
our app can implement them for clinics.

The Four Offer Types to Maximize Customer Value
Hormozi defines four kinds of offers that together prompt customers to spend more, sooner, and more
often :
Attraction Offers – Front-end deals that turn strangers into customers. These are often free or low-
priced promotions to get new clients in the door and recoup acquisition costs later .
Upsell Offers – Tactics to get customers to spend more cash immediately. Once the customer makes an
initial purchase, upsells present additional solutions (bigger or complementary) to boost the
transaction value .
Downsell Offers – Methods to turn “no” into “yes”. If a customer declines a primary offer (or upsell), a
downsell offers a more affordable or accessible alternative so you still capture revenue .
Continuity Offers – Strategies to keep customers buying repeatedly. These create recurring revenue
through subscriptions, memberships, or repeat purchase programs, maximizing lifetime value .
Each offer type serves a specific purpose in the customer journey. Below, we detail key techniques under
each category and how they can apply to clinics.
Attraction Offers: Bringing New Patients In (and Covering Acquisition Cost)
Attraction offers are irresistible front-door deals to quickly acquire new customers . The aim is to
generate immediate upfront cash or value that at least covers the cost of getting that customer, so the
business isn’t bleeding money on marketing . For a clinic, attraction offers help turn prospects into
first-time patients by lowering their risk or giving a big incentive. Key attraction tactics include:
“Win Your Money Back” Challenges: Customers pay upfront for a program or challenge with the
chance to earn their money back upon achieving a result . This boosts commitment by reducing
risk – if they succeed, they get a refund (often as credit toward other services). Example: A weight-loss
clinic could charge for a 6-week program and promise a full refund as clinic credit if the patient hits
their health goal. Only ~10% might earn the refund, so the clinic’s costs are limited . Our app can
enable clinics to set up challenge programs and automatically track criteria, then issue in-app
credits instead of cash refunds (keeping revenue in the business).
Grand Prize Giveaways & Contests: Advertise a chance to win a big prize to attract lots of leads .
One person wins the grand prize, everyone else “wins” a promotional offer. This way, every entrant
becomes a potential paying customer. Clinic example: A dental clinic runs a giveaway for a “Free
Smile Makeover”. The winner gets it free; all other entrants get a special discount on a cleaning +
whitening package. Our app can manage contest entries and then auto-send promotional offers to
non-winners. Tip: The prize must be truly exciting to drive interest, and adding a referral bonus (e.g.
if a referred friend wins, you both win) can multiply leads .
Decoy Offer (Good-Better Deal): Lead with a free or very cheap offer as a “decoy,” but when the
prospect bites, reveal a much more valuable premium option side-by-side . The contrast makes
the premium offer extremely appealing in comparison. Example: A clinic advertises a free basic
health screening (the decoy). When patients come, the app can present: “Basic Screening (Free) or
Full Wellness Exam + Personalized Plan (£99).” By seeing them together, patients recognize the
superior value of the £99 package and often choose it. (As Hormozi quips, ask if they want “free stuff

or lasting results?” before presenting the paid option .) Our app can support this by allowing
clinics to configure tiered offers and by training staff (through on-screen prompts) on how to present
the premium option first.
“Buy X, Get Y Free” Bundles: An offer where purchasing one thing gets additional items free .
People love “free,” so this often converts better than a straight discount – as long as the core product’s
price covers the cost of the freebies . For instance, a physical therapy center could offer “Buy 3
sessions, Get 1 Free.” The clinic ensures the package price is set slightly higher than 3 sessions
normally, so the 4th is essentially covered, but the patient perceives high value. Our app can let
clinics create bundle deals and ensure pricing guidelines (e.g. “raise prices before giving stuff
away” to preserve margins ).
“Pay Less Now or Pay More Later” Deals: Give customers two payment choices: either pay a
discounted price upfront or pay full (higher) price later, with a guarantee . This creates
urgency to buy now while still appearing risk-free. Example: A cosmetic clinic could say: “Procedure is
£1200 if you pay now, or £1500 if you pay later only if you’re fully satisfied (money-back guarantee).” Many
will opt to pay now for the lower price, but the guarantee option builds trust that the service will
work . Our app can handle these conditional pricing structures and even enforce conditions (e.g.
require attending all follow-ups for the guarantee to apply ).
Free Goodwill Offers (Value First): Offering free helpful content or minor services to build goodwill
and trust . Hormozi himself gave away tons of free advice (and even free copies of his book) to
generate positive reviews and word-of-mouth . For clinics, this could mean free health tips
newsletters, webinars, or a free initial consultation. While not directly a paid offer, our app’s patient
engagement features (like automated health tips, blog content, or Q&A chat) can serve this
purpose – warming up prospects so they’re more likely to convert and review the clinic positively.
Upsell Offers: Getting Patients to Spend More (Right Away)
Once a customer has said “yes” to something, that’s the best moment to offer more. Upsells capitalize on
the “hyper buying cycle”, when a customer is excited about their purchase and open to additional value
. Hormozi notes the initial sale often just covers costs – the real profit comes from second, third, fourth
offers . Our app will help clinics maximize revenue per visit by smart upselling. Key upsell strategies
include:
Classic Upsell (“You’ll also need…”): Immediately offer a solution to the next problem or need that
arises from the customer’s first purchase . For example, “You got X, you might need Y as well”. In a
skin clinic, if a patient buys a facial treatment, the app could prompt staff to offer the matching
after-care kit or an add-on laser therapy. The idea is to anticipate what complements the initial
service (“You can’t have X without Y!” logic ). Tip: Present the most profitable upsell first and phrase
it in a way that assumes they’re probably all set (reverse psychology like “You don’t want the deluxe
package too, do you?” often nudges people to add it) . Our app can display upsell
recommendations at checkout and train staff with these scripts.
Menu (Four-Step) Upsell: This is the structured approach Alex used to skyrocket supplement sales
at gyms . It involves: (1) Unsell – oddly, start by telling the customer what they don’t need, to
build trust that you’re not just selling everything . (2) Prescribe – based on their situation,

recommend exactly what they do need (tailored solution) . (3) Offer A vs B – give two good
options to avoid a yes/no situation (e.g. “We have Plan A and Plan B – which do you prefer?”) . (4)
Make It Easy – simplify payment (card on file, financing, etc.) so saying “yes” is frictionless . In
our app, we could implement a guided “Upsell Wizard” for staff: e.g. after a service, it walks them
through asking a few questions (to unsell irrelevant stuff, then prescribe the right follow-up service/
product), then presents two tailored upgrade options and offers one-click payment. This empathetic,
consultative upsell method massively increases conversion – Prestige Labs used it to jump from \
$270K to \$1.6M in monthly sales in 8 weeks with the same products .
High-Anchor Upsell: Present a very high-end option first as an anchor, so that your main offer looks
reasonable by contrast . People’s first reaction (“sticker shock”) sets an anchor in their mind. For
instance, a clinic might first mention a platinum wellness package at £10,000. After the patient
gasps, you then show them your primary offer, a gold package at £2,000 – which now feels much
more attainable. The key is the anchor offer should be 5–10× the price of the main offer and
something you’d be happy if they take (even though most won’t). Our app can support this by
allowing clinics to configure tiered packages and automatically displaying the highest tier first in
proposals or on-screen menus.
Rollover (Upgrade) Upsell: Here you give credit for past purchases (even from competitors)
towards a bigger package . It’s a powerful way to win back lapsed customers or encourage
upgrades. For example, “If you’ve previously paid for X sessions (or you were at another clinic), we’ll credit
that amount toward our premium program.” This makes the customer feel their prior spending isn’t
wasted and lowers the barrier to buy the high-ticket offer. Hormozi even suggests doing this before
processing any refund – instead of losing a customer who wants a refund, credit that amount if they
upgrade to a longer-term plan . Our app can track each patient’s purchase history (and even
allow entering competitor receipts) to auto-calculate an upgrade credit. We can also automate “win-
back” campaigns – e.g. if a patient hasn’t visited in 6 months, send an offer to apply their last
payment as credit towards a new service.
Upsells in our app: At the point of booking or payment, the app will pop up suggested add-ons or higher-
tier options configured by the clinic. It can use rules (or AI) based on the patient’s profile and initial service.
By implementing upsells, clinics will not only increase their average transaction value, but also often see
their biggest profit growth here – remember, “your first offer doesn’t always make the profit… you make
it on the second, third… and beyond” .
Downsell Offers: Capturing Revenue When Patients Say “No”
Not everyone will say yes to your primary offer or upsells – but you can still salvage the sale. Downsells
provide a plan B (or C) so a customer who balks at price or commitment can choose an alternative, rather
than walk away empty-handed . For clinics, downsells ensure that even if a patient declines the ideal
treatment plan, you offer something more accessible. Key downsell techniques:
Payment Plan Downsells: If cost is the objection, instead of discounting, offer to spread the cost
over time . The patient gets the same service but with bite-sized payments, which often feels
more affordable. Hormozi’s process is to have a hierarchy: always reward paying in full (maybe a
bonus for upfront payment), but if they can’t, fall back to financing options – e.g. third-party
financing, or in-house plans like “half now, half later,” then 3-pay, then 6-pay, etc., and only as a last

resort a free trial . Our app’s billing system can make this seamless: clinics can toggle any
invoice into an installment plan with automated recurring charges. We’ll also allow setting payment
incentives – e.g. “pay upfront and save 10%” – rather than framing installments as a penalty .
Trial with Penalty (Conditional Trial): Offer a free or heavily discounted trial if the customer meets
certain conditions, otherwise they pay a fee . This downsell is great if the patient is skeptical or not
ready to commit. For example, a therapy clinic might say: “Try the first session free. If you follow the
program (e.g. attend all sessions or achieve a result) and you’re not satisfied, you owe nothing. But if you
quit early or don’t meet the agreed conditions, we charge a fee.” The psychological effect: truly
interested customers see it as risk-free to try, and those who aren’t serious self-select out (or pay the
fee if they drop). Always collect a credit card upfront for these trials – our app will enforce
capturing payment info before starting the trial and automatically charge the penalty if conditions
aren’t met (sending reminders about the terms). For integrity, the app can have patients e-sign the
trial agreement (e.g. “I agree to attend 4 sessions or pay the fee”).
Feature-Scaled Downsells: If the full package is too much, offer a stripped-down version at a lower
price by removing features or reducing scope, rather than just discounting the price . For
instance, if a patient can’t afford the deluxe 10-session treatment plan, the clinic could offer a 5-
session basic plan (fewer sessions, or fewer perks included). The idea is to remove some value to
reduce cost, so the patient feels they got a plan tailored to their budget, without devaluing the
premium offer’s price . Our app can help by letting clinics create tiered service versions and
quickly toggle features on/off to generate a custom downsell on the fly. A smart tactic here: when
presenting the downsell, make it clear what is lost compared to the main offer – sometimes seeing
what they’d miss convinces the customer the higher-priced option is worth it (a “re-upsell”) !
Either way, the patient has a choice that fits their budget. We’ll also allow clinics to standardize this
process (e.g. always first remove the least-critical feature to drop price) so front-desk staff can
execute it easily .
Overall, downsells ensure “No” doesn’t mean no sale at all, just “not that offering.” As Hormozi puts it,
“‘No’ means no for this thing, not no for everything.” By equipping our app with downsell paths (payment
flexibility, trials, lighter offers), we help clinics convert hesitant prospects into paying customers and
maximize conversion rates.
Continuity Offers: Getting Patients to Buy Again and Again
Continuity offers create recurring revenue streams – the holy grail of predictable growth. Rather than one-
off transactions, continuity keeps customers paying over time via memberships, subscriptions, or
maintenance plans . For clinics, this might mean monthly wellness plans, annual service
subscriptions, or VIP clubs. These not only boost lifetime value but also improve patient outcomes (through
consistent engagement). Key continuity strategies from the book:
Continuity Bonus Offers: Incentivize patients to start a membership by giving an upfront bonus that
is so valuable it outweighs a few months’ fees . For example, a medspa could offer a “Join our
monthly skin health club for £99/month and get a free laser treatment (worth £300) upon
signup.” The large bonus entices sign-ups and justifies the subscription. Plus, continue giving small
monthly bonuses or perks to keep them excited (e.g. each month members get a free sample
product or a minor service). The key is to focus marketing on the bonus value more than the

membership itself . Our app’s membership module will let clinics configure one-time joining
bonuses (and automatically grant them) and recurring perks for members. This was the approach
Hormozi’s Gym Launch used – they added a free bonus for subscribing, which skyrocketed customer
annual value to ~$42K and monthly revenue 4.6× from $380K to $1.76M in six months .
Subscription Discounts & “Weekly” Billing Hack: Encourage longer commitments by offering
additional service time or discounts for signing a contract . For instance, “Subscribe for 12 months
and get 1 month free” or “Pay for the full year upfront and save 15%.” These are common, but Hormozi
adds a clever twist: bill on a 4-week cycle instead of monthly . Charging every 4 weeks yields 13
billings per year instead of 12, quietly boosting annual revenue by ~8.3% with no price increase
. Our app will support flexible billing intervals (clinics can choose weekly, biweekly, every 4
weeks, etc.) so they can implement this “highest value per word” insight . We’ll also let clinics easily
offer prepayment discounts or bonus time. Additionally, we’ll require capturing two forms of
payment on file for subscriptions (e.g. credit card + bank ACH) – this is another pro tip to reduce
involuntary churn if a card fails.
Waived Fee Commitment Offers: Structure pricing to penalize short-term customers and reward
long-term commitment . For example, a physiotherapy clinic might have a £200 sign-up fee for
month-to-month clients but waive that fee if the patient commits to a 6-month plan. The hefty
startup fee pushes people toward the longer term (nobody wants to pay a big fee for nothing), and if
they do go month-to-month, that fee at least boosts initial revenue. Hormozi suggests making the
fee 3–5× the monthly price to really nudge behavior . Our app’s membership settings will allow
clinics to configure sign-up fees and automate waiving it when the commitment contract is chosen.
By essentially making “leaving cost more than staying” , patients stick around much longer,
increasing their lifetime value.
Continuity programs are how clinics can maintain a steady cash flow and not start each month from zero.
Using our app to implement memberships, clinics can “keep people buying” over the long run – which
is exactly the recurring revenue mechanism Hormozi credits for building durable, 9-figure businesses.
Integrating $100M Money Model Tactics into the Clinic App
Now, let’s map these strategies into features and design choices for our app. By building tools for each
part of the Money Model, we empower clinics to execute these tactics easily and effectively:
Offer Builder for Promotions: Our app will include an Offer Creator that lets clinics design
Attraction offers like free trials, challenges, or limited-time bundles. This feature can provide
templates (e.g. “6-Week Challenge (Win Your Money Back)” or “Grand Prize Giveaway”) based on
Hormozi’s proven models . Clinics can fill in their specifics (prize, criteria, etc.), and the app
will generate the sign-up forms, landing pages, and even social media graphics. We’ll guide them on
best practices (like offering credit refunds instead of cash , using deadlines for urgency, and
pricing core offers to absorb “free” bonuses ).
In-App Upsell Suggestions and Bundling: To get patients to spend more per visit, our scheduling
and point-of-sale system will support upsell prompts. For example, when a receptionist books a
service, the app can pop up: “Upsell Opportunity – patient booked a basic cleaning, consider offering
teeth whitening add-on.” The app can present a small menu of recommended upsells (with the script:

e.g. “Many patients also get X for best results. Would they like to add that?”) . Clinics will be able to
pre-configure these add-on suggestions and even set conditions (like only show upsell Y if patient
has X and not Z). Our app can also facilitate bundled packages easily – allowing multiple services/
products to be combined with special pricing. This makes executing menu upsells or anchor
packages straightforward: e.g., show the premium bundle first (anchor) , then the standard
bundle. By systematizing upsells, we ensure clinics don’t forget to offer that extra service or product
that can significantly boost their margin (remember, upsells often drive the biggest profits ).
Flexible Payment and Downsell Options: A powerful feature will be our Payment Flex module,
which lets clinics offer instant payment alternatives. At checkout, if a patient hesitates or says they
can’t afford it, staff can click “Offer Payment Options” – and the app will display choices like “Pay in 4
installments”, “Pay half now, half later”, or “Try first session free – card will be charged if no-show”. These
options correspond to the downsell tactics (payment plans, trial with conditions) we outlined
. The app will handle the scheduling of payments or capturing credit card for trials. Additionally,
the app can store multiple service tiers so staff can quickly switch to a feature-reduced offer if
needed (e.g. select a “Basic plan” version for 20% less) . Having these downsell pathways built-in
means the clinic staff are never stuck – the software proactively gives them ways to save the sale
when a patient says “not sure” or “too expensive.”
Membership & Subscription Management: To enable continuity offers, our app will have a robust
membership management system. Clinics can create membership plans (e.g. monthly, quarterly,
annual) with included services, discounts, or perks. Critically, we support recurring billing on
custom cycles (including every 4 weeks to implement the 13-cycle year hack ). Clinics can set up
upfront enrollment fees or cancellation fees, and the app will automatically apply or waive them
based on the patient’s commitment length (implementing the “waived fee” model ). We’ll also
integrate automated retention tools: for instance, if a member’s payment fails or they consider
canceling, the app could trigger a retention offer (like a bonus service if they stay). By making
continuity easy to manage, we help clinics tap into recurring revenue and increase each customer’s
lifetime value significantly.
Analytics: Track 30-Day ROI and LTV: To reinforce the Money Model mindset, our app’s analytics
dashboard will show clinics how quickly they recoup customer acquisition costs. If the clinic
inputs their average ad spend or referral cost per new patient, the app can display 30-day revenue
per new customer and flag whether they are 2× above CAC . It will also chart repeat purchase
rates and upsell take-rates. Seeing these metrics will encourage clinics to utilize the app’s upsell and
continuity features to hit that magic 2× in 30 days goal . Essentially, the app not only provides the
tools but also measures the results, closing the loop for continuous improvement.
Patient Engagement & Affiliate Integrations: In line with Hormozi’s advice to offer more ways to
buy rather than more things , our app can help clinics extend their offerings without heavy lift.
We could integrate a marketplace of third-party products/services relevant to clinics (e.g. wellness
products, supplements). A clinic can choose to upsell these affiliate products through the app
(earning a commission) to fill any gaps in their value ladder . For example, a chiropractic clinic
might not sell vitamins, but through our app’s partner marketplace they can recommend a vitamin
package to patients and make extra revenue with zero inventory. Additionally, our built-in
communication tools (email/SMS campaigns, content library) let clinics regularly provide free value
content – educating patients, showcasing success stories, and subtly promoting new offers. This

keeps patients engaged and primed to take up the next offer, achieving the “spend again and again”
aspect through trust and relationship-building .
In summary, by implementing Hormozi’s $100M Money Model strategies in our clinic app, we equip our
users (the clinics) to maximize customer value at every step. They’ll attract more new patients with
compelling front-end offers, immediately monetize those patients with upsells that solve the next
problem, save potentially lost sales with downsells, and lock in long-term revenue with memberships. All of
this is done ethically and transparently – solving real problems for patients while boosting clinic profits
.
The end result? Clinics using our app can grow faster, more profitably, and predictably. By getting each
customer to spend more, sooner, and more often (and feeling happy about it because they receive great
value), our users’ businesses will thrive. Hormozi’s playbook has been proven to scale companies to eight
and nine figures, and now those same principles will be at our users’ fingertips – baked directly into the app
experience.

Implementing $100M Money Models to Boost
Customer Spend in a Sonography Clinic SaaS
Key Concepts from $100M Money Models by Alex Hormozi
Alex Hormozi defines a “Money Model” as a deliberate sequence of offers that maximizes how much and
how fast each customer spends . Instead of losing money on customer acquisition and recouping it
slowly, a strong Money Model makes each new customer profitable within 30 days, generating cash to
fund more growth . Hormozi’s framework focuses on four core offer types – Attraction, Upsell,
Downsell, and Continuity – to get customers to spend more money, faster, and repeatedly . The idea
is that by combining these offers, businesses create a self-sustaining loop where every customer’s initial
purchase covers its own acquisition cost (and then some), enabling rapid scaling .
Attraction Offers: Introductory deals that turn strangers into first-time buyers. These are often free
or heavily discounted offers designed to grab attention and get customers in the door quickly, with
the expectation of earning profit on what they buy next . The goal is to kickstart the
relationship (and cash flow) as soon as possible.
Upsell Offers: Follow-up offers that immediately increase a customer’s value by encouraging them
to spend more right after the initial purchase. Upsells solve the customer’s “next problem” or
desire and leverage the fact that a buyer is in a “hyper-buying” state once they’ve said yes once .
Typical upsells include a higher-tier version, a larger quantity, or complementary add-ons .
Downsell Offers: Backup offers that capture revenue when a customer says “no” to the primary
offer or upsell. Rather than losing the sale, a downsell tweaks the deal (smaller bundle, payment
plan, fewer features) to fit the customer’s budget or hesitations . This turns potential losses
into profitable “yeses” by meeting the customer halfway without simply slashing price.
Continuity Offers: Ongoing subscriptions or memberships that get customers to buy repeatedly
over time. Continuity provides recurring value (e.g. ongoing service, refills, exclusive perks) for a
regular payment, boosting lifetime value and building predictable revenue . Incentives like
bonus gifts for signing up, discounted rates for longer commitments, or waived fees encourage
customers to stick around . Even small billing tweaks (charging every 4 weeks instead of monthly
yields 13 payments/year) can increase revenue by 8.3% with no extra sales .
Each mechanism targets a different part of the customer journey, but together they compound: attract
more customers, get each to spend more, and keep them coming back, resulting in exponential growth
. Below, we break down how to apply each of these methods in your UK sonography clinic SaaS product
– with concrete feature recommendations, user flows, automations, pricing, and messaging – so your clinic
clients can get their customers to spend more, faster, and repeatedly, just as Hormozi prescribes.
Attraction Offers: Converting New Visitors into Paying Customers
Attraction offers are irresistible first-purchase deals engineered to acquire customers quickly. The key is
to provide high perceived value at little or no cost upfront – strategic “free” offers – so that even skeptical

prospects take the leap . Hormozi emphasizes that an attraction offer should ideally cover its own
acquisition cost or even generate positive cash on day one . Instead of the typical free trial that costs
you money (e.g. gyms giving free sessions and losing cash for months), the $100M Money Model approach
is to get a paying commitment immediately by structuring the deal cleverly . Examples include
“Pay and Win Your Money Back” challenges, product giveaways where non-winners get a discounted offer
(so almost everyone ends up buying), a low-priced “decoy” product that funnels customers to a higher-value
option, or “Buy X Get Y Free” bundles that feel like a steal .
In a sonography clinic context, attraction offers will help clinics pull in new expectant parents early in the
pregnancy and jump-start the revenue cycle. Here’s how to operationalize this tactic in the SaaS:
First-Scan Special Packages: Enable clinics to create a heavily discounted or value-packed “New
Patient Offer” in the system. For example, a clinic could offer an “Early Gender Peek” ultrasound
at £30 (normally £60) with a free baby scan photo keepsake. This low barrier offer gets them in the
door. The SaaS should support marking certain services as first-time offers (perhaps one per
customer) and apply an automatic discount or bonus for eligible new customers. The pricing
structure in the admin panel should allow a “first scan” flag so the clinic can set a special price or
added value for newcomers. The messaging in the booking UI can highlight “First time here? Enjoy
50% off your first scan!” to attract strangers into becoming customers.
“Win Your Scan Free” Promotion: Taking inspiration from Hormozi’s challenge model, clinics could
run a promotion where customers pay for a service but have a chance to get it refunded as credit.
For instance, expectant mothers pay for a 4D scan and if the baby’s gender is correctly
predicted at an early scan, they “win” a refund in clinic credit to use on future services or
products. The SaaS can facilitate this by allowing a promotional rule: collect payment normally, then
if certain conditions are met (the clinic staff can mark outcome), automatically issue credit to the
customer’s account equal to the scan price. This way the clinic isn’t doing free scans out-of-pocket;
someone always pays, either they keep the money or the customer gets it back but must spend that
credit on other clinic offerings (ensuring repeat business). This Attraction Offer format creates
excitement and draws in lots of customers quickly, while the “store credit refund” ensures the cash
stays in the ecosystem .
Lead-Generating Giveaways: The platform could include a simple contest feature to support
Hormozi-style giveaways. For example, a clinic might run a “Free Ultrasound for a Year” contest
(grand prize: a package of scans throughout pregnancy). Entrants submit their details (name, due
date, etc.) via a landing page (powered by our SaaS). After the draw, non-winners are automatically
sent a “consolation prize” offer: perhaps a discount code for 20% off their first scan or a free add-on
product if they book. This aligns with the “partial scholarship” idea where everyone wins something
. Our product’s automation can handle emailing the discount codes to all entrants once the
clinic selects a winner. This turns a free contest into a list of warm leads and converts many into
paying customers immediately with the follow-up offer. The PRD should note a new feature:
Contest & Coupon Automation, including a form page for sign-ups and an email trigger with an
offer to participants.
Decoy vs. Premium Option in Booking Flow: Implement a service bundling interface that lets
clinics set up a low-cost basic option and a contrasting premium package. For example, during
online booking the customer might see “Basic Scan – £40 (15-min 2D scan, 1 photo)” next to
13

15 14
16

“Deluxe Baby Bonding Package – £99 (30-min 4D scan, HD images, video + free heartbeat
teddy)”. By juxtaposing a bare-bones offer with a feature-rich one, the clinic uses the decoy
effect: the basic option gets them interested (it's cheap or free to reserve), but most will gravitate to
the high-value package once they see how much more they get . Our SaaS should support side-
by-side package comparisons on the booking page and allow clinics to tag one as “Most Popular”
or “Best Value” to guide choice. This upsells by design during attraction – a tactic straight from
Hormozi’s playbook of advertising one offer but presenting a more attractive one immediately .
Analytics to Ensure Profitability: To align with Hormozi’s mandate that attraction offers should pay
for themselves quickly, build a reporting dashboard showing each clinic owner metrics like: average
revenue from first-time customers in 30 days vs. cost per acquisition. If our SaaS integrates or allows
input of marketing spend, we can show that 30-day gross profit ≥ 2× (CAC + cost of service)
for their attraction offer, as Hormozi suggests is needed for a self-funding growth loop. While this is
more on the analytics side, it helps clinics tweak their offers or ad spend to ensure the initial deal
isn’t too generous. (For instance, if a clinic’s first-offer customers aren’t buying anything afterward,
the report would flag a negative ROI, prompting a strategy change).
By implementing the above, new customer acquisition becomes a self-liquidating investment: clinics
get more people through the door with enticing offers, yet still come out cash-positive or break-even
immediately. The SaaS product should make it easy to configure these deals and track their performance.
This forms the foundation (Stage I of the Money Model: “Get Cash”) – turning “strangers into customers”
profitably .
Upsell & Cross-Sell Offers: Maximizing Immediate Customer Value
Once a patient has booked a scan or made a purchase, they’ve signaled trust – now is the prime moment to
present additional offers. Hormozi notes that customers enter a “hyper buying cycle” after saying yes to
something; they are far more likely to say yes again to related offers . Upsells capitalize on this
psychology by offering more value for a bit more money: “Would you like fries with that?” is the classic
example . Effective upsells either give more of the same product, a better version of it, or something
complementary that enhances the initial purchase . In our context, this means adding products or
services to amplify the ultrasound experience or outcome. Cross-selling related items (e.g. merchandise,
additional services) fits here as well – it’s essentially a type of upsell presented as a separate category of
product.
For UK sonography clinics, upsells and cross-sells will directly boost average spend per visit. Our SaaS
should incorporate an “Upsell Engine” that intelligently offers these add-ons during booking and after the
appointment. Here’s how to implement it:
Expanded Product Catalog for Clinics: First, we need to ensure the system allows clinics to offer a
wide range of physical products and add-on services in addition to the core scanning sessions.
Many clinics already sell heartbeat teddy bears and confetti cannons; we can broaden the catalog
with innovative, high-margin items to increase the upsell opportunities. For example, clinics could
offer:
Personalized heartbeat keepsakes (e.g. jewelry or keychains engraved with the baby’s heartbeat
waveform),
3D printed baby figures (a small 3D replica of the baby’s face from the ultrasound data),
18

Digital packages (like a downloadable video of the 4D scan, or a subscription to a private baby photo
sharing app for family),
Nursery and gender-reveal accessories beyond confetti cannons (e.g. smoke grenades, gender
reveal balloons, or themed reveal boxes with curated goodies ),
Maternity and baby boutique items (partnered products like newborn onesies that say “Hello
World”, mom-to-be gift boxes, etc., which some ultrasound studios successfully sell ).
Our app’s Product Management module should let clinics easily add such items (including stock, price, and
descriptions) so they appear as upsell options. By innovating the range of products, clinics give customers
more ways to spend. In fact, clinics that introduce at least two strategic add-on products see 18–22% higher
quarterly revenue than those selling scans alone . The PRD impact: we must support a robust
inventory system and possibly integrations with suppliers (for items like heartbeat bear recorders or
SneakPeek test kits).
Upsell Recommendations in Booking Flow: When a client is booking a service online (or when staff
are invoicing a customer in-clinic), the system should present targeted upsell offers at the optimal
moment. This is often on the checkout page after the customer selects their primary service but
before payment confirmation. For example:
If a user adds a standard 2D scan to their cart, the software should prompt: “Upgrade to a 4D HD
Live Scan for just £30 more and get a free printed photo!” (a better version upsell – showing a
premium option first as an anchor ).
If they’ve chosen a 4D package, it could suggest: “Add a Heartbeat Teddy Bear with your baby’s
recorded heartbeat for £35?” (a complementary product upsell).
If they already added a product like a bear, maybe suggest “Add a second bear for Grandma at
20% off” (more of the same).
Offer bundles as upsells: “Bundle and Save: 4D Scan + Gender Reveal Kit + Heartbeat Bear for £149 (save
£20)”. This not only raises the immediate ticket, it frames the larger purchase as a better deal
(leveraging the “comparison effect” to make the premium bundle look like a smart choice ).
To implement this, we’ll build a rules-based upsell engine: clinics can define which products or services
should be suggested in response to what the customer selected. A simple admin UI might allow the clinic to
say “When customer books X, prompt with Y at checkout (with optional discount)”. The upsell UI should use
persuasive microcopy, e.g. “Most moms in your stage go for this upgrade!” and show the savings or extra
value clearly. This aligns with Hormozi’s “menu upsell” strategy of guiding customers to the best fit by
showing options in a structured way . Our SaaS essentially acts as the silent salesperson: it should
“unsell” irrelevant options (don’t bombard them with everything, just 1–2 tailored suggestions) and
“prescribe” the ideal add-on for them . This builds trust and avoids choice overload, much like Hormozi’s
script of telling the customer what they don’t need before pitching what they do need .
In-Clinic Upsell Scripts & POS Support: For in-person clinic visits (many customers book online but
pay or decide on extras on site), we should arm the staff with an upsell script and tools via the app.
For instance, the SaaS could show a “Upsell Checklist” on the appointment details screen for staff:
reminding them to ask “Would you like to hear your baby’s heartbeat? We can record it in a teddy for
you.” The Prestige Labs case in Hormozi’s book showed that a simple four-step upsell script (unsell,
prescribe, offer choice A/B, make payment easy) massively increased sales . We can integrate this
by:
Providing staff with a prompt on their screen of recommended add-ons based on the appointment
type (e.g. if it’s a gender scan, prompt staff to offer gender reveal confetti or SneakPeek test kit).

The interface can list two choices for the customer if appropriate (mirroring the “Offer A or B, not
yes/no” tactic ). For example: “We have two popular add-ons: A) a heartbeat bear for £35, or B) a
deluxe frame for your ultrasound prints for £25. Which would you prefer?” This A/B framing
increases the likelihood of an upsell because the customer is choosing between upsells rather than
simply accepting or declining one.
Simplified payment: ensure the POS app allows one-tap adding of the upsell item to the bill so the
checkout is frictionless (if they say yes, staff shouldn’t fumble through multiple screens – our design
should let them add the item on the spot, e.g. a quick “+ Add Teddy” button).
By standardizing these practices through the software, even clinics without natural salespeople on staff can
consistently execute upsells. The result can be dramatic: using a structured upsell approach turned a $270k/
month supplement business into $1.6M/month in eight weeks . While sonography clinics are smaller
scale, the principle holds – our clients could similarly see their average order value jump by 30-50%. In
one real example, a Texas ultrasound studio increased AOV from $120 to $165 by introducing a $35 bear
and $129 early gender DNA test upsell – an extra $45 per customer, translating to ~$13.5k more per
month at their volume . We should aim to make such success replicable via our app’s upsell features.
New Upsell Product Ideas & Logistics: We will collaborate with clinics to innovate new upsell
offerings and ensure our SaaS supports delivering them. Some ideas:
Early Gender DNA Testing (SneakPeek Clinical): This is a blood test that determines gender as
early as 8 weeks. It’s a proven high-margin upsell for ultrasound studios (often £100+ price) and
drives an extra visit for sample collection . Our system could integrate with such third-party
services (or at least allow tracking it as a product with booking an appointment for the blood draw).
We can include an information page in the booking flow about this add-on (educating customers on
accuracy and even offering a money-back guarantee if results are wrong ). Since 82% of those
who buy the early test still return for the actual scan later , it doesn’t cannibalize ultrasound sales
– it’s additive. This will increase repeat visits and revenue per customer.
Personalized Media & Keepsakes: The SaaS could offer an online gallery where after their session,
clients can order extra prints, photobooks, or digital downloads. For example, after a scan, the
system emails a link: “View your ultrasound photos”. Inside, they can select to purchase a printed
album, canvas print of the ultrasound image, or even a gift bundle for grandparents (we could
partner with a print-on-demand service). These are cross-sell opportunities post-appointment. Our
platform should support e-commerce transactions for such items and tie them to the customer’s
existing data (images, recordings captured). If the clinic saved the baby’s heartbeat audio, an
automation could prompt: “You still have your baby’s heartbeat recording on file – order a Heartbeat
Bear or Heartbeat Jewelry and keep it forever!”. This kind of follow-up upsell taps into the emotional
value of the experience and can be done via email or app notification a day or two after the scan
(when the excitement is still high).
Time-Sensitive Upsell Incentives: To drive urgency, implement features like “today-only” offers.
For instance, the app can display or allow staff to offer: “Get £5 off the heartbeat bear if you
purchase it before you leave today.” This echoes the advice of offering a small discount or bonus
for immediate uptake (hitting the scarcity/urgency bias ). We should allow clinics to configure
such promo rules (e.g. “X item £5 off if bought on same day as scan”) and the POS should
automatically apply it. This increases conversion on upsells that customers might otherwise say “I’ll
think about it” and never return.

Upsell/Cross-Sell Logic & A/B Testing: We will need to refine the upsell algorithms over time. The
SaaS should track which upsell offers are shown and whether they’re accepted or skipped, providing
analytics on uptake rates. This way, clinics (and we as product designers) can see what combos work
best. Perhaps one clinic finds that offering a photo frame sells better as an upsell for 20-week
scans, whereas bears sell best for first scans. We could allow A/B testing of upsell offers: e.g., for
half of customers, show Offer A vs. Offer B and compare conversion. This data-driven approach will
optimize immediate revenue per customer in line with Hormozi’s mandate to squeeze as much profit
as possible in that initial window .
By implementing a smart upsell/cross-sell system, we ensure that once a clinic acquires a customer, the
value of that customer multiplies right away. The motto here is “don’t let a customer walk out with only
what they came for.” If they booked a £50 scan, we want them leaving having spent £100+ happily, because
they got additional value (keepsakes, upgrades) that enhanced their experience. All the while, our SaaS
makes this process systematic and easy to execute, increasing revenue per appointment for our clinic users.
Downsell Offers: Saving the Sale When Customers Say “No”
Even with great attraction offers and upsells, some customers will hesitate or decline an offer due to price
or other concerns. Instead of losing these opportunities, Hormozi advocates using downsell offers –
modified deals that address the objection and still capture revenue . A downsell is essentially a
fallback option: if the customer doesn’t buy the primary offer, you present a cheaper or lower-commitment
alternative that they can say yes to. The trick is to maintain value perception (don’t just give a random
discount that devalues your service) – rather, reduce the scope or use flexible payment structures to make it
more palatable . For instance, offering a payment plan, a trial period, or a slimmed-down version of the
service are common downsells .
In the context of our clinic SaaS, downsells will typically come into play either during the booking flow (if
someone is about to abandon) or at point-of-sale if a client refuses an upsell or premium package. We want
to catch the “no” and turn it into a “yes” with smart alternatives. Here’s how to implement downsell
tactics:
Booking Abandonment Rescue: If a potential patient starts a booking for a high-end service or
package but doesn’t complete it (drops off at the payment page, for example), the SaaS can trigger a
downsell offer via email/SMS shortly afterward. For example: “We noticed you were interested in our
Premium 4D Package. If the full package isn’t the right fit, how about a Mini 4D Scan for half the price?
You’ll still get a peek at your baby in 4D and 2 photo prints. Click here to book the mini-session.” This
feature downsell reduces the price by delivering a scaled-down service (shorter session, fewer
prints) . The system knows what they were considering, so it can offer a closely related but
cheaper option automatically. We’ll need to implement abandoned cart tracking in the booking
system and templated communications for specific downsell offers tied to the service they
abandoned. The PRD should list an “Abandoned Booking Downsells” feature with logic like: if cart >
£X or contains specific service, and not completed in Y hours, then send Offer Z.
Payment Plan Option: For big-ticket purchases (maybe a multi-scan bundle or an expensive add-on
like a £129 DNA test combined with a scan package), our platform should let clinics offer a payment
plan downsell. Hormozi mentions breaking payments into installments to address “too much up
front” objections . In practical terms, if a customer balks at a £150 package at checkout, the
5.

UI could present: “Spread the cost: pay £50 now and £50/month for the next 2 months – no interest.” This
way, the customer might accept the offer in installments even if they wouldn’t in one lump sum. To
enable this, our SaaS would integrate with a payment provider or have in-built support for splitting
payments. We must include installment payments as a pricing option in the PRD (with rules for
how many installments, auto-billing, etc.). Additionally, at checkout, show a clear toggle like “Pay in
3 installments” if the order qualifies. This can salvage sales for cost-conscious customers, boosting
overall conversion.
Downselling Upsell Rejections: If a customer explicitly says “no” to an upsell in the flow, we can
immediately follow with a softer offer instead of just a dead-end “No thanks” button. For example, if
they decline the £35 heartbeat bear upsell online, the next screen could present a downsell like: “No
problem! Perhaps you’d like a smaller keepsake: how about a set of 5 photo prints for £10?” or “Would you
be interested in a digital recording of the heartbeat for £5 which you can keep?”. This way, we still try to
increase the order value with a lower-priced item or a digital good that costs the clinic almost
nothing. The system should allow chaining offers: Upsell declined → trigger alternate offer. We must
be careful in UX to not annoy the user with endless offers, but a single downsell prompt after an
upsell rejection is generally acceptable. This logic would be configured in the Upsell Engine as a
secondary option (e.g., define a fallback item for each upsell).
Limited Feature Trials: Another downsell approach from Hormozi is “trial with penalty” – e.g., let
them try something for free or cheap, but if they don’t follow through on an action, they pay . In a
clinic scenario, this could be tough, but one idea: “Unsure about committing to our membership? Try it
for one month free – if you don’t come in for your scan that month, we’ll charge you a £20 no-show fee.”
This is complex and might feel risky to implement, so we might skip direct use of this. Instead, we
can spin a simpler trial downsell: “Not ready to book the full package? Book a single session now at
regular price, and if you decide to upgrade to the package afterward, we’ll credit your first session toward
it.” This is essentially a rollover upsell tactic but framed as a downsell: the patient can commit
small now and still have the chance to get the full value later without losing money. To support this,
the system should allow upgrading purchases: e.g., detect if someone who bought one-off later
buys the package, and then automatically discount the package by the amount they already paid (or
give a credit). This encourages tentative customers to say yes to something now (the smaller
commitment) because they know they can apply it to the bigger thing later – removing the fear of
“wasting money” on a smaller purchase first.
Interface and Messaging: In terms of UI, any downsell should still feel like a solution to the
customer, not just a cheaper price. Our content strategy should emphasize phrasing like “We have an
alternative that might suit you:” or “We understand – maybe this option is a better fit for your budget/
time.” This maintains trust and credibility, showing we want them to get value on terms
comfortable for them . From a development perspective, we’ll incorporate a modular offer
widget that can present different offers (upsell or downsell) based on conditional logic (accepted/
declined). This will likely involve front-end modals or pages with dynamic content and backend rules
controlling sequence.
By catching refusals and offering thoughtful alternatives, we ensure fewer customers leave without buying
something. In Hormozi’s terms, downsells help “find the highest value the customer will buy” instead of
leaving their money on the table . For our clinic SaaS, this means higher overall conversion rates on
bookings and sales. Even if a customer doesn’t go for the premium package or expensive add-on, we can

still increase their spend modestly via downsells. This directly contributes to more revenue for clinics and a
better ROI on their marketing efforts.
Continuity Offers: Driving Recurring Revenue and Repeat Visits
Continuity offers are all about getting customers to keep spending over time – turning one-time buyers
into subscribers or members. In $100M Money Models, continuity is the stage where you secure long-term
cash flow: e.g., monthly memberships, subscriptions, or repeat purchase programs . For many
businesses, this is the holy grail because it builds predictable income and maximizes lifetime value.
Hormozi stresses that continuity works best when you entice the customer to commit and then continually
deliver value so they don’t cancel . Tactics include giving a big one-time bonus for signing up (making
the first few payments feel “free” in value), offering discounted rates for longer-term prepayment, or
charging penalties/fees for shorter terms to push people to stay longer . Also, he notes creative billing
tricks like weekly billing cycles to subtly boost revenue .
For sonography clinics, the concept of continuity might seem challenging – pregnancy itself is a limited
timeline, not an ongoing need like a gym or software subscription. However, we can still implement
continuity in clever ways: think memberships that cover the pregnancy journey, packages of multiple
scans, or even extending into the post-pregnancy period with related services. Our SaaS should provide
features for clinics to run such programs. Here’s how we make continuity offers work in this context:
Pregnancy Membership Plans: Introduce a membership module in the SaaS where clinics can
create subscription plans for expecting parents. For example, a clinic could offer a “Baby Journey
VIP Membership” for a flat fee or monthly payment. This membership might include a series of
scans throughout the pregnancy (e.g., early scan, gender scan, 3D/4D later, plus perhaps a
newborn photo session or priority scheduling). The key is packaging it as a bundle that delivers
ongoing value and convenience:
Tiered Plans: e.g., Silver Plan (£Monthly fee gets you 2 scans and 1 free merchandise item), Gold Plan
(3 scans, plus priority booking, a free heartbeat bear, etc.), Platinum (all of the above plus a newborn
photography session, etc.).
Our system needs to support recurring billing for these plans (charging monthly or allowing an
upfront one-time payment with services redeemed over time). It should track the services included
and allow the customer to easily schedule their included sessions via their account.
To encourage sign-ups, apply Hormozi’s Continuity Bonus concept: give something immediately
valuable for free when they join . For instance, “Join the Baby Journey plan today and get a free HD
ultrasound video package (worth £50).” The bonus should be high-value (maybe a large framed
portrait or a goodie bag of baby products) – ideally more than the first month’s fee – so the customer
feels they’re getting a bargain upfront . Our app’s PRD should include a field for “Signup Bonus”
in the membership configuration, which can be an item or service that automatically gets added to
their account when they subscribe.
Also implement Continuity Discount Offers: e.g., “Pay for 3 months and get the 4th month free” or
“sign up for the whole 9-month package and save 15% versus pay-as-you-go.” Clinics should be able
to configure these in the pricing (either as a prepaid package or a month-to-month with a minimum
term to get the freebie) . Our billing system should handle the free month or discount logic.

Retention Features for Membership: Once customers are on a continuity program, we need to
help clinics keep them engaged and happy (reducing churn). Within the SaaS, include a
membership portal where members can see upcoming appointments, how many scans they have
left, and exclusive content (e.g., pregnancy tips, or a timeline of baby’s development with their scan
images – something to add value beyond the scans themselves). We can set up automated
touchpoints: for example, monthly “what to expect this month” emails to pregnant members, reminders
to schedule their next included appointment (“It’s week 20 – time for your anomaly scan, click to
book!”), and perhaps partner offers (e.g. discounts from local baby stores for members). These perks
reinforce the value of the membership so customers are less likely to cancel early. Our product
should allow clinics to customize these communications. In the PRD, this is essentially a CRM
automation for members.
Additionally, implementing the weekly/bi-weekly billing option could be considered if a clinic wants to
charge frequently (though monthly might be more standard in UK). If feasible, offering a 4-week billing
cycle option for memberships would yield that extra 8% revenue over annual period – we can mention
this to our clients and support it in the billing settings. It might not be common in this industry, but it’s a
low-effort way to boost revenue if customers accept it.
Multi-Session Packages (Continuity as Bundle): Some clinics may prefer selling packages of
sessions rather than an open-ended subscription. Our SaaS should support bundle offers – e.g.,
“Three Scan Bundle: Early, Mid, and Late Pregnancy scans for £200 (save £50)”. This is essentially a
continuity offer where the customer pays upfront (or can split pay) for multiple visits. It locks in their
repeat business. To operationalize this:
The system should treat it as a product that, when purchased, creates credits or vouchers for the
included services on the user’s account. So when the patient later books each scan, it uses one of
their pre-purchased credits (and charges £0 at booking).
The pricing structure should allow discounts on bundles and perhaps the “Buy X get one free”
logic (e.g., buy 3 sessions, get the 4th free – common in fitness, but could apply like “book 3 scans, get
a free maternity photo shoot” as a bonus). This lines up with continuity discount tactics .
We also ensure these customers are flagged as high-LTV in our CRM so clinics give them VIP
treatment, increasing satisfaction and referrals.
Post-Pregnancy Continuity and Referrals: While a single pregnancy has an end date, continuity
can extend into referral programs or second-order revenue (more on referrals in the next section).
But also, some clinics diversify into related services – for example, baby’s first year portraits, or even
follow-up wellness scans. If our clients have such offerings, the membership could extend to those:
e.g., a membership tier that includes a newborn photoshoot or a “first birthday” free mini-shoot
to keep the customer engaged beyond birth. This not only spreads out the revenue timeline but also
creates an emotional connection that might make the family come back for future pregnancies or
send friends. Our SaaS can allow membership plans to include third-party or one-off perks like
“voucher with partner photographer” etc., effectively orchestrating cross-service continuity.
Admin & Roadmap Considerations: The introduction of continuity features is a significant addition
to the product. We will need to plan development of:

Recurring Payment System: Integration with payment gateways for subscriptions, handling
failures (and maybe prompting a secondary payment method if primary fails – aligning with best
practices to reduce churn due to payment issues ).
Membership Management UI: For clinic admins to create/edit plans, set terms (minimum
commitment, cancellation policy), bonuses, etc., and for customers to sign up and view their
membership details.
Analytics for Lifetime Value: Provide reporting on metrics like average membership length, churn
rate, LTV of members vs non-members. This shows clinics the value of continuity. We can incorporate
some industry stats into our material, e.g., “On average, subscription patients have X% higher
LTV.” (From general knowledge, even outside Hormozi, e.g., subscription models greatly increase
total spend.)
In essence, continuity offers shift the business from one-off transactions to a relationship model. By
implementing memberships or multi-visit packages via our SaaS, UK sonography clinics can achieve more
stable revenue and stack revenue on top of itself each month rather than starting from zero with
each new customer. This is Stage III of Hormozi’s model – “Get the Most Cash” by maximizing long-term value
. We’ve built the attraction (to get them in) and monetized the immediate upsells; continuity now keeps
them spending over the months to come.
Reactivation Campaigns: Re-Engage Customers to Spend Again
Reactivation strategies focus on bringing back past customers who have become inactive or who didn’t
complete an intended purchase. While not explicitly a part of Hormozi’s four core offers, reactivation aligns
with maximizing LTV and retention (which he covers in the Delivery and Profit systems). It’s far cheaper to
get an existing or lapsed customer to return than to acquire a brand new one, and a good reactivation offer
can be very effective in boosting repeat revenue . In a sonography clinic scenario, reactivation might
target: - Expectant parents who came for an early scan but haven’t booked their later scans. - Customers
who bought something like a gender reveal, but never returned for a 3D scan. - Long-term: past clients who
had a baby 2+ years ago – perhaps now pregnant again or can refer a friend.
Our SaaS should empower clinics to identify and win back such opportunities through automation and
targeted offers. Here’s how we can implement reactivation features:
Automated Follow-Up Schedules: We will incorporate a lifecycle communication system that
automatically sends timely messages based on the customer’s stage and behavior. For example:
If a customer did an early pregnancy scan (say at 8 weeks), and now it’s been 8-10 weeks since with
no new booking, trigger a reactivation email: “Your baby’s growing fast! It’s a great time for a 12-week
scan. Book now and we’ll include a free frame for your ultrasound photo.” This reminds the customer of
the next milestone and sweetens it with a small bonus, nudging them to return. The system’s rules
engine can check: if customer at X weeks gestation (we can calculate from due date) and hasn’t booked
the recommended next service, send Offer Y. The PRD will specify Event-Based Triggers (e.g., time
since last visit, or reaching a certain pregnancy week).
Similarly, if someone only came for a mid-pregnancy scan, at around week 30 we send: “See how
much your little one has grown! Come for a 3D/4D session and get 15% off since you’re a returning client.”
After the due date (if we have it on file), a congratulatory message can go out with perhaps a
newborn photography offer or a discount on prints of their ultrasound images as keepsakes.

Even though they might not need ultrasound now, this keeps the relationship warm and could
generate additional merchandise sales or referrals.
To implement this, the system needs to store the customer’s expected due date (collected at first booking
perhaps) and have a scheduler for communications. We’d add a “Reactivation Campaigns” section in the
admin where clinics can customize these messages/offers and set the timing rules. The actual sending can
be via email or even SMS (for immediacy, since UK clients often provide mobile numbers when booking).
Win-Back Offers for No-Shows or Cancellations: If a customer cancels an appointment or simply
never schedules another after an initial inquiry, we should send a win-back offer. For example, if
someone cancels a booking, an email the next week might say: “We’re sorry you couldn’t make it. Here’s
a £10 coupon to reschedule your scan whenever you’re ready – we’d love to see you and your baby!”. This
personal touch with a small incentive can reclaim potentially lost business. Our app can detect
cancellations and automatically generate a single-use coupon code for that client, including it in the
message. The PRD item: Cancellation Follow-up with Incentive.
Post-Purchase Check-In & Cross-Sell: After a customer’s appointment, aside from asking for
reviews, we can also re-engage them with additional product offers (if they didn’t buy them initially).
For instance, two weeks after their scan, an email could say: “Hope you’re enjoying your ultrasound
photos! In case you missed it, we offer custom photo albums and canvas prints of your ultrasound images.
As a past customer, you get 10% off any print order this month.” This might entice them to spend on
keepsakes now that they’ve shown off the initial pics to family. It’s a way of extracting more value
after the service is done. The SaaS can have a “Post-Visit Upsell” automation set for certain product
categories. We’d integrate it with our e-commerce functions so they can click and purchase directly
from that email/link using their stored info.
Dormant Customer Reactivation: For customers who have been completely inactive for a long
period (say 9-12 months, which likely means they had their baby and haven’t been back), clinics can
still engage them strategically. One approach is leveraging those happy memories for referrals or
future pregnancies:
Send a friendly check-in around the baby’s first birthday: “Happy 1st Birthday to your little one from
[Clinic Name]! We loved being part of your journey. If you or a friend is ever expecting again, here’s a gift:
£20 off a scan package.” This both celebrates the customer (goodwill) and plants a seed for referrals
or their next baby. Including a referral code in this message can double as a referral program
prompt (more below).
Alternatively, some studios invite past clients to come for “milestone” keepsakes – e.g., come back
for a “toddler heartbeat recording” or just visit with your baby so we can take a photo next to their
ultrasound picture for fun (maybe a stretch idea, but could be a marketing gimmick for social
media).
Implementing this would use our CRM data to filter customers by last service date and send out predefined
campaigns. The PRD might call this Long-Term Reactivation Emails with templated “Happy Birthday” or
seasonal greetings that include offers.
Monitoring and Optimization: Provide clinics with a reactivation dashboard that shows how many
lapsed customers were contacted and how many came back and spent. This will help quantify the
impact (e.g., “Reactivate 50 lost customers at £x each adds £y revenue”). If certain offers (like the £10

11
reschedule coupon or the 15% off 3D scan) prove very effective, the clinic can double down, or the
SaaS could even suggest “best practice” reactivation campaigns based on aggregated data from all
clinics.
The impact on the app roadmap includes building a sophisticated CRM automation component. We
might integrate with existing marketing automation tools or build in-app capabilities to send emails/texts
and manage coupon codes for these scenarios. It’s a chunk of work, but it’s crucial for maximizing repeat
business.
For clinics, these reactivation features mean they can capture additional spend from customers who
might otherwise slip away, increasing the overall lifetime value. Even if an ultrasound client won’t need
another scan soon, reactivation can generate merchandise sales or referrals (which leads us to…).
Referral Program: Turning Customers into Advocates for Viral
Growth
A referral program incentivizes existing happy customers to introduce new customers. This is an incredibly
powerful way to get repeated revenue indirectly – your past customer brings you another, effectively
multiplying the value of the original customer. While referrals aren’t explicitly one of Hormozi’s four offer
types, they are consistent with his overarching goal: get more customers as cheaply as possible and have
each customer yield more (if one customer brings in a second, your cost of acquisition plummets and you
acquire faster). In fact, referred customers tend to spend more and stay longer due to the trust factor of a
personal recommendation . Studies have shown referred customers have about a 25-31% higher
lifetime value and initial spend compared to non-referred , and companies with referral programs
see significantly higher retention rates (up to +37%) . For our clinic SaaS, implementing a referral
system will not only help clinics get more bookings (which means more usage of our app) but also fits
perfectly with the community-driven nature of prenatal services (expecting parents often know other
expecting friends).
Here’s how we’ll design the referral program feature and integrate it:
Digital Referral Codes/Links: Each customer who books through the platform can be assigned a
unique referral code or link (e.g., REF12345 or a personalized one like their name). The SaaS will
generate this automatically and display it on booking confirmation pages, in emails, and perhaps in
a user account area (if clients can log in). We’ll add a section like “Refer a Friend: Give £X, Get £Y”
where it explains the deal. A likely structure: the referred friend gets a discount on their first scan
(e.g., £10 or 10% off), and the referrer gets a reward once the friend completes a purchase.
Hormozi’s advice and industry stats suggest double-sided incentives work best , so both parties
benefit and are motivated to act.
Referral Rewards Structure: Define what the referrer receives: it could be store credit in the app
(for the clinic’s services/products), a free add-on (like a free photo print or heartbeat bear) on their
next visit, or perhaps cashback. For example, “Refer a friend and you get a £20 credit towards your next
ultrasound or merchandise, and your friend gets 20% off their first booking.” The SaaS should be flexible
to let each clinic configure the reward amounts/types to fit their pricing. We will likely encourage
credit or free service rewards (rather than pure cash) to ensure the referrer comes back to use it –

thus generating more business for the clinic. The PRD will include a Referral Program Settings page
for clinics: set referral discount for new customer, set reward for referrer (with options like fixed
amount credit, % discount, or specific item free).
Seamless Referral Tracking: When the referred friend uses the code or link to book, the system
must attribute that to the referrer. We’ll need to store relationships (referrer -> referee) and ensure
the discount is applied on the new customer’s order automatically. Once that order is completed, the
system should then issue the reward to the referrer – e.g., generate a credit coupon in their account
or flag them for a free item redemption. An automated email can also notify the referrer: “Thank you!
Your friend just had her scan. £20 credit has been added to your account for your next visit!” This instant
gratification encourages continued referrals. All of this logic (referral code apply, discount given,
reward granted) will be handled in the backend and reflected in the clinic’s dashboards.
Promoting the Referral Program: Encourage clinics to promote this program via our provided
channels. We can have the booking confirmation page or follow-up email explicitly prompt: “Loved
your experience? Share this code with an expecting friend and you both benefit!” We could also integrate
social sharing: a button to “Share your referral link on WhatsApp/Facebook” since a lot of this target
demographic chat in mom groups or social media. Mobile optimization is key – Deloitte research
shows 72% of referrals happen via mobile devices . We should ensure any landing page for the
referral link is mobile-friendly and perhaps pre-fills the code for ease. Moreover, adding a small
banner in the clinic’s waiting room (if they have a tablet sign-in via our SaaS) or printed on receipts
can help – the clinic can use our provided referral code in marketing collateral as well. Our role is to
make it easy for them to get the word out.
Referral Analytics and Fraud Prevention: Provide the clinic with stats on how many referrals are
happening, conversion rates, and ROI (e.g., how much revenue referrals brought vs. rewards given).
This will show them the value – for instance, “This month you got 10 new clients via referrals, costing
you £200 in discounts, but bringing in £800 in revenue.” Also, implement basic fraud checks (e.g.,
ensure people can’t refer themselves with duplicate emails, perhaps limit one reward per referred
customer, etc.). This will be outlined in the technical requirements to ensure the program isn’t
abused.
The impact of a well-run referral program can be substantial. As an example statistic, businesses with
formal referral programs experience a 24% lower customer acquisition cost and significantly
higher customer lifetime value. For clinics, word-of-mouth is already a major factor (mothers love to talk
and recommend good experiences). By formalizing it in the SaaS, we accelerate that word-of-mouth and
track it. This directly ties into Hormozi’s theme of getting more customers without relying solely on ad
spend – your existing customers become a growth engine. In the PRD, the referral program will be a
major feature set under the marketing tools of the platform.
Impact on Product Roadmap and Development
In summary, implementing these $100M Money Model tactics translates to concrete features and user
stories in our Product Requirements Document (PRD) and will guide our development roadmap. Below is a

consolidated list of recommendations and how they map to actionable product changes, ready for
developer implementation:
Attraction Offer Module: Add functionality for clinics to create special introductory offers (e.g.,
discounted first scan, contest giveaways). This includes UI for configuring first-time customer
discounts or “win-back credit” promotions, and automation for handling rewards (like credit refunds
if conditions met). Roadmap: High priority – foundational for customer acquisition (Q1 release).
Dynamic Checkout with Upsells/Downsells: Develop a smart checkout flow that supports
inserting upsell prompts and, if declined, downsell offers. This requires a rule engine and a flexible
front-end modal/page design. Also integrate with the booking system so that these offers appear
contextually (online checkout and in-clinic POS). Roadmap: Staged delivery – basic upsell functionality
in Q2, enhanced with conditional downsells by Q3.
Product & Inventory Management for Merchandising: Enhance the SaaS to handle physical
product sales (heartbeat bears, etc.) – including adding product items, managing stock, setting
bundles/discounts. Ensure these can be attached to appointments or sold standalone. Roadmap: Q1-
Q2 as part of upsell system (since upsells depend on having products to offer).
Membership/Subscription System: Build out the continuity offers capability: allowing clinics to
create membership plans or multi-session packages, handle recurring billing (integrate with
payment gateways for subscriptions), and track usage of included services. Include features for
offering bonuses (free gifts on signup) and discounts for long-term commitments. Roadmap: This is a
larger feature – aim for Q3 delivery with thorough testing (complexity: high).
CRM Automation & Communications: Implement an automated email/SMS engine tied to
customer events (booking abandonment, time since last visit, pregnancy timeline). Pre-build
templates for reactivation offers and allow clinics to customize. This also covers referral invitation
emails and membership engagement emails. Roadmap: Begin Q2 with basic transactional emails
upgrade, expand to full marketing automation by Q3.
Referral Tracking System: Develop the referral program infrastructure: unique referral codes/links,
applying referral discounts at booking, and issuing referrer rewards (credit or coupons) post-
purchase. Include an admin UI for program configuration and a user-facing element for sharing
referrals. Roadmap: Q2 implementation, as it leverages some of the coupon/credit systems from
attraction and continuity work.
Analytics & Dashboard: Update the dashboard to reflect metrics relevant to these money models –
e.g., first 30-day revenue per customer, uptake rate of upsells, revenue from continuity members,
referral performance, and churn rates. This gives clinics feedback and proof of concept (and helps us
fine-tune features). Roadmap: Continuous – add metrics with each feature rollout (starting Q2). For
example, once upsells are live, track upsell conversion; once memberships live, track retention.
Ethical/Transparent Configurations: Ensure that all these features are implemented in a customer-
friendly way (as Hormozi cautions, trust is paramount ). For instance, clearly show savings,
don’t hide terms (our UI should have info icons or pop-ups explaining any “pay later” conditions or
membership cancellation policies). Also, adhere to UK regulations (no misleading “free” claims, etc.).

This isn’t a separate feature but a guiding principle for developers when building these flows (to
avoid dark patterns that could harm clinic reputations long-term).
By incorporating the above into our PRD and development cycles, we align our clinic SaaS product with the
proven strategies from $100M Money Models. Each feature directly helps clinics get their customers to spend
more (through upsells/cross-sells), faster (through compelling front-end offers that self-fund
acquisition), and repeatedly (through continuity programs, reactivations, and referrals). Ultimately,
these enhancements will make our platform indispensable for clinics looking to boost revenue, and will
differentiate us in the market by offering not just management tools, but built-in growth and
monetization systems for our clients.

- Add Compliance-friendly terms, guarantees, and fee disclosures

Would you like to:
- Merge or split any items?
- Prioritize (Q1/Q2/Q3)?
- Tag items as frontend, backend, payments, analytics?

Once you confirm, I’ll generate a precise Claude prompt for each item.

---

**User**

can you examine my existing codebase, cross off any of the todos that are actually already implemented. 

If there are none implemented, fine. I am not suggesing there are, I am just asking just in case there is.

---

**Cursor**

I'll scan the repo for any existing implementations of these monetization features (offers, upsell/downsells, memberships, referrals, CRM automations, analytics) to cross off what's already done.

I searched the codebase for promotions/offers, upsell/downsell logic, memberships/subscriptions, referrals, CRM automations, and related analytics. I didn’t find any existing implementations of those features.

- Nothing to cross off; the TODO list stands as-is.

If you’re ready, I can prioritize these and then draft Claude prompts per item.

---

**User**

Prompts one at a time please. As we iterate the prompts further down the todo may change so lets not get ahead of outselves. Yes, prioritise and then we beign with the FIRST prompt.

---

**Cursor**

I'll set priorities and mark the first task in progress, then provide Claude with a focused prompt for that first item.

- I prioritized the list and set “Enhance Product & Inventory management” as in progress so Claude can build the foundation other features depend on.

### Prompt 1 for Claude: Enhance Product & Inventory management
You are contributing to a React + TypeScript + Vite app for a sonography clinic platform. Goal: add Product & Inventory management to support merchandise and add-ons sold with appointments and standalone.

Context
- Tech: React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind (present), Recharts (already used), no backend yet.
- Current files: `App.tsx` (all-in-one UI), `types.ts`, `constants.ts`, `components/Icons.tsx`, `services/geminiService.ts`, `index.tsx`, `index.css`.
- No existing products, inventory, checkout, or persistence logic.

Deliverables
1) Types and state
- Add strong types in `types.ts`:
  - Product { id, name, sku?, description?, priceGBP: number, imageUrl?, stockQty?: number | null, isActive: boolean, categories?: string[] }
  - ProductVariant? only if needed later (avoid unless required).
  - CartItem { productId, quantity, unitPriceGBP }
- Add seed demo products in `constants.ts` (e.g., Heartbeat Bear, Photo Prints Pack, Gender Reveal Kit).
- In `App.tsx`, add top-level state: `products`, `setProducts`; simple persistence via `localStorage` load/save.

2) Admin management UI
- Add a minimal Products Admin view inside `App.tsx` (extend existing view switch):
  - List products (name, price, stock, active toggle).
  - Create/Edit modal: name, price, stock (nullable), active toggle, optional description, image URL.
  - Basic validation: name required, price >= 0, stock null or >= 0.
  - Save updates state + localStorage.
- Add a “Products” entry to sidebar with icon from `components/Icons.tsx`.

3) POS add-ons hook points
- In Booking/Checkout context (existing `BookingModal` and appointment flow), enable adding products to a lightweight cart:
  - For now, a simple inline “Add product” button opens a small selector of active products; selecting adds a `CartItem` with quantity 1 (allow +/-).
  - Show calculated subtotal: service price + cart items.
  - When booking is confirmed, attach a read-only snapshot of selected `CartItem[]` and total to the appointment object for later display in recent appointments list (do not implement payment yet).
- Add a `formatGBP` helper to display prices.

4) UX polish
- Use Tailwind classes matching existing style.
- Handle empty state (no products).
- Gracefully handle localStorage JSON parse errors.

5) Constraints
- No backend calls; keep all state client-side.
- Keep edits scoped; do not refactor unrelated parts.
- Maintain TypeScript strictness and avoid any.
- Do not break current views.

Acceptance criteria
- I can add/edit/deactivate products in a Products view, persisted across reloads.
- I can add one or more products to a booking in `BookingModal`, see quantities and a combined subtotal.
- The resulting appointment stores the selected products snapshot and total.
- Build runs without TypeScript or linter errors.

If anything is unclear, make reasonable assumptions and implement.

**User**

thanks, but claude will determine the structre etc. We just need to tell it what to implement, not how. Going foreward, can we please do prompts like that

---

**Cursor**

Set “Enhance Product & Inventory management” in progress. Now I’ll give Claude a concise, outcome-focused prompt without dictating structure.

### Prompt 1 for Claude — Enhance Product & Inventory management
Implement Product and Inventory management to support selling merchandise and add-ons both with appointments and standalone.

Scope
- Product catalog: create/read/update/deactivate products; optional images, categories, stock tracking, active/inactive.
- Inventory: track stock where applicable; prevent adding inactive/out‑of‑stock items.
- Attach products to bookings: during booking/checkout, allow adding one or more products (quantities) and show combined subtotal with the selected service.
- Persist data so products and selections survive reloads (no external backend required for now).
- Admin UI: simple product list with create/edit/deactivate; basic validation and clear empty states.

User stories
- As a clinic admin, I can add/edit products and toggle availability.
- As staff/patient during booking, I can add available products to my booking, adjust quantity, and see updated totals.
- As clinic staff, I can view which products were attached to an appointment after booking.

Acceptance criteria
- Products can be created/edited/deactivated and are persisted locally.
- Only active, in‑stock products can be added to a booking; quantities validated.
- Booking flow shows service price + product subtotal + combined total.
- Appointments store a snapshot of chosen products (name, unit price, quantity) and the computed totals.
- No type or build errors; existing flows remain functional.

---

**User**

It has completed that prompt. What is next

---

**Cursor**

Product & Inventory management is done. I’ll mark it complete and move on to “Bundles and Buy X Get Y pricing,” then give Claude the next prompt.

### Prompt 2 for Claude — Bundles and Buy X Get Y pricing
Implement Bundles and “Buy X Get Y” pricing to increase average order value.

Scope
- Bundles: allow clinics to create fixed bundles that combine multiple services/products at a special price or % discount; display bundle savings during booking/checkout; add entire bundle to cart in one action.
- Buy X Get Y: support rules like “Buy 3 sessions, Get 1 free” or “Buy 2 bears, Get 20% off the 3rd”; enforce eligibility automatically in cart and show applied benefit clearly.
- Eligibility and limits: support per-item and category-based rules (e.g., “any 3 photo products”), optional per-customer usage limits.
- Persistence: persist bundle/rule definitions locally; applied benefits should be reflected in totals and stored with the booking snapshot.
- Admin UI: create/edit/activate/deactivate bundles and BXGY rules; show validation and a preview of what the rule does.

User stories
- As an admin, I can define bundles and BXGY rules and toggle them on/off.
- As staff/patient, I can add a bundle in one click and see savings.
- As staff/patient, BXGY discounts apply automatically when my cart qualifies, with a clear line item.

Acceptance criteria
- Bundle items and BXGY benefits are calculated correctly and included in cart/booking totals.
- Only active rules apply; deactivated rules do not.
- Saved bookings include a readable breakdown of bundle components and BXGY discounts.
- No regressions to existing product/booking flows.

**Cursor**

Claude finished Bundles/BXGY. I’ll mark it complete and start the Upsell Engine task, then send the next prompt.

### Prompt 3 for Claude — Rules-based Upsell Engine (Checkout + POS)
Implement a rules-based Upsell Engine to increase average order value during booking/checkout and in-clinic POS.

Scope
- Targeted upsells: surface 1–2 relevant add-ons or upgrades based on what’s in cart/booking (services, bundles, products) and customer context.
- Placement: show upsells at key moments (after selecting primary service, pre‑payment, and in POS during appointment).
- Offer types: higher-tier upgrade, complementary add-on, quantity bump (“add a second for X% off”), and preconfigured bundles as upsells.
- Rules: allow admins to define simple conditions (e.g., “if Gender Scan selected, suggest Heartbeat Bear” or “if 2D scan, suggest 4D upgrade for £X more”); include priority and active/inactive.
- UX: clear copy showing incremental price/savings; easy add/remove; avoid spamming (cap suggestions).
- Tracking: record which upsells were shown and accepted/declined with the booking snapshot for later analytics.
- Persistence: persist upsell rule definitions locally; applied upsells must be reflected in totals.

User stories
- As an admin, I can define and toggle upsell rules and their display priority.
- As a customer/staff, I see 1–2 high‑relevance upsell suggestions at checkout/POS with one‑tap add.
- As a clinic, I can later see which upsells were shown and which converted.

Acceptance criteria
- Only active, eligible upsells appear; totals update correctly when accepted.
- Upsell display is context‑aware and rate‑limited (no flooding).
- Bookings store an itemized record of suggested vs accepted upsells.
- No regressions to existing product, bundles/BXGY, or booking flows.

**User**

cladue finished that prompt - check the terminal for info. Whats the next prompt?

---

**Cursor**

Upsell Engine marked complete based on your note. I’ll move to “Downsell logic with payment plans and feature-scaled offers” and provide Claude the next outcome-focused prompt now.

### Prompt 4 for Claude — Downsell logic with payment plans and feature‑scaled offers
Implement downsell mechanisms to save sales when customers decline primary or upsell offers.

Scope
- Payment plans: offer configurable installment options (e.g., half-now/half-later, 3‑pay, 6‑pay) for eligible carts; auto-calculate schedules, update totals, and persist plan choice with booking.
- Feature‑scaled offers: provide “lite” versions of services/bundles (reduced scope/features) as an alternative when user declines; clearly display what’s removed and new price.
- Conditional trial/credit: optional trial/upgrade credit flow (e.g., “buy single now, credit applied if upgrading to package later”) stored and redeemable automatically.
- Triggers: show a single, respectful downsell prompt after a decline or on checkout hesitation; avoid spamming.
- Admin: create/edit/activate downsell rules for payment plans and scaled offers; simple eligibility controls.
- Tracking: record when downsells were shown/accepted and reflect discounts/plan fees in the booking snapshot and totals.

Acceptance criteria
- Only active, eligible downsells appear; exactly one prompt per decline event.
- Installment plans validate amounts and generate a clear schedule; totals and due‑today update correctly.
- Scaled offers show a side‑by‑side comparison and, if accepted, replace the original selection.
- Bookings persist chosen plan/scaled offer details and are visible post‑booking.

can you read the terminal? the session limit has been reached. I will now open codex, can you please give me a prompt for it to pick up where claude left off?

I’ll hand off to Codex at the same point: “Downsell logic with payment plans and feature‑scaled offers.”

### Prompt for Codex — Downsell logic with payment plans and feature‑scaled offers
Implement downsell mechanisms to save the sale when users decline a primary or upsell offer.

Scope
- Payment plans: configurable installment options (e.g., half‑now/half‑later, 3‑pay, 6‑pay) for eligible carts; auto-calc schedule, update totals, persist chosen plan in the booking.
- Feature‑scaled offers: provide a “lite” version of selected service/bundle (reduced scope/features) as an alternative; clearly show what’s removed and new price; replace selection if accepted.
- Conditional credit: allow “buy single now, credit applied if upgrading to package later”; store and auto-apply credits on upgrade.
- Triggers: show one respectful downsell prompt after a decline or checkout hesitation; cap to one prompt per event to avoid spam.
- Admin: create/edit/activate downsell rules (payment plans, scaled offers, credit-on-upgrade); simple eligibility toggles.
- Tracking: record which downsells were shown/accepted; reflect plan fees/discounts in totals; persist details with the booking snapshot.

Acceptance criteria
- Only active, eligible downsells appear; max one prompt per decline event.
- Installment plans validate amounts, show due‑today + schedule, and update totals correctly.
- Scaled offer comparison is clear; accepting replaces original selection and updates totals.
- Credits on upgrade are stored and automatically applied when upgrading later.
- No regressions to existing products, bundles/BXGY, upsells, or booking flows.

I dug into the existing upsell/bundle admin module to add downsell, payment-plan, scaled-offer, and credit management, but the file’s existing encoding/formatting was highly inconsistent (lots of “A�/Â£” artifacts). When I tried to extend the component, those artifacts caused repeated patch failures, and one fallback script inserted a large block in the wrong place, leaving App.tsx in a badly mangled state (mixing sections together and duplicating content). With no git history or clean copy to restore from, I can’t safely finish the downsell work—or even get the app compiling—until we get back to a pristine App.tsx. Could you restore the original App.tsx (or share a clean copy)? Once we have that, I can reapply the downsell changes carefully, keeping the encoding consistent and validating each step.

I'll inspect `App.tsx` to confirm the corruption and see if I can reconstruct a clean baseline from what’s still intact. If it’s too mangled, I’ll ask you for the last known good copy.

- I cleaned the obvious encoding artifacts in `App.tsx` (replaced mojibake with proper characters like £, ▲/▼, ✨). If the file was only blocked by those, it should compile again.

Next steps
- Try a build/run. If it still fails or content is structurally duplicated/misaligned, please share the last clean `App.tsx`, and I’ll restore it and then reapply the downsell/payment-plan/scaled-offer/credit features carefully.

**User**

what should I pormpt codex then

---

**Cursor**

Use this with Codex first to restore a clean baseline before continuing downsell work.

Prompt for Codex — Restore App.tsx to a clean, compiling UTF‑8 baseline
The file App.tsx became corrupted by bad encoding and mismerged blocks. Please restore it to a pristine, compiling state without removing already-completed features.

Scope
- Fix encoding to UTF‑8. Replace mojibake characters with correct glyphs:
  - Replace “A�/Â£/Aï¿½” with “£”
  - Replace “Ã¢â€“Â²/Ã¢â€“Â¼” with “▲/▼”
  - Replace “Ã¢Å“Â¨” with “✨”
- Remove any duplicated or misplaced sections inserted by a failed edit. Keep component/function order logical and non-duplicated.
- Ensure previously completed features remain intact and working:
  - Product & Inventory management
  - Bundles and Buy X Get Y pricing
  - Rules-based Upsell Engine
- Do not implement new downsell/payment plan logic in this step.
- Ensure TypeScript builds, React compiles, and the UI renders.
- Keep existing styling and Tailwind classes.
- Save with consistent formatting and no extraneous artifacts.

Acceptance criteria
- App compiles with no type errors.
- No mojibake remains (all currency shows as £, icons render correctly).
- No duplicated/misaligned JSX or logic blocks.
- Product/Inventory, Bundles/BXGY, and Upsell Engine still function as before.

When done, I’ll give the next prompt to implement downsell/payment plans/scaled offers/credits.

**User**

can you help me run this app

---

**Cursor**

Here’s the quickest way to run it on your Windows machine.

Commands (PowerShell)
- cd "C:\Users\Nathaniel\Documents\sonorecall---sonography-clinic-platform (1)"
- npm install
- $env:API_KEY="your-google-genai-api-key"   # optional, only needed for Gemini features
- npm run dev
- Open http://localhost:5173

If you hit errors
- process is not defined (from services/geminiService.ts):
  - Quick workaround: set a build-time define so Vite injects the key.
    - In PowerShell before running dev: $env:API_KEY="..." and then:
    - Add this to vite.config.ts inside define: { 'process.env.API_KEY': JSON.stringify(process.env.API_KEY || '') }
  - Or, don’t use Gemini features for now (avoid image/video edit buttons).

- Port already in use:
  - npm run dev -- --port 5174
  - Then open http://localhost:5174

- Dependency issues:
  - Delete node_modules and package-lock.json, then run: npm install

Want me to apply the vite.config.ts define for you and re-run?

---

**User**

how do I push this to github

---

**Cursor**

### Push this project to GitHub (PowerShell)

1) Initalize git and ignore build/deps
- cd "C:\Users\Nathaniel\Documents\sonorecall---sonography-clinic-platform (1)"
- git init
- git config user.name "Your Name"
- git config user.email "you@example.com"
- git config core.longpaths true
- echo node_modules/`n`dist/`n`.env`n`.DS_Store`n`*.local`n`*.log > .gitignore

2) Commit your code
- git add .
- git commit -m "Initial commit"

3) Create the GitHub repo
- Option A (web): Create a new empty repo on GitHub (no README/.gitignore).
- Option B (CLI): gh repo create your-username/sonorecall-clinic-platform --private --source . --remote origin --push

4) Add remote and push (if you used the web)
- git branch -M main
- git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
- git push -u origin main

### If the repo already exists locally
- git remote -v
- If no origin: git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
- git push -u origin main

### Common issues
- Auth popup: Sign in with GitHub in the browser when prompted, or use a PAT.
- “Filename too long” on Windows: git config core.longpaths true (already set above).
- Pushing to a non-empty GitHub repo: pull first or create a new empty repo.

Want me to generate a good README and a fuller .gitignore tailored for Vite + TypeScript?

**User**

I think I've just pushed it?

---

**Cursor**

Great—let’s quickly verify.

Run these in your project folder:
- git remote -v
- git branch -vv
- git log -1 --oneline
- git push -u origin main

If that push says “Everything up-to-date,” you’re good. Then open the repo:
- If you have GitHub CLI: gh repo view -w
- Or paste the repo URL here and I’ll sanity-check it.

If your branch is master instead of main:
- git branch -M main
- git push -u origin main

Optional: set the GitHub default branch to main in the repo settings.

From the screenshot, you’ve only run git init. There’s no remote yet, so nothing is pushed.

Do one of the following:

Option A — VS Code button
- Click “Publish Branch” (top-left Source Control).
- Sign in to GitHub when prompted and create the repo.
- After it completes, you’ll see “origin” under Remotes.

Option B — CLI (PowerShell)
- cd "C:\Users\Nathaniel\Documents\sonorecall---sonography-clinic-platform (1)"
- git add .
- git commit -m "Initial commit"
- git branch -M main
- git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO.git
- git push -u origin main

Verify
- git remote -v  (should show origin)
- git status     (should be clean)
- git log -1 --oneline
- Open the repo URL on GitHub and confirm files are there.

---

**User**

can you check the cli

---

**Cursor**

I can’t see your terminal. Please run these and paste the output:

- git remote -v
- git branch -vv
- git status
- git log -1 --oneline
- git push -u origin main

If push fails, also run:
- git config user.name
- git config user.email
- git config core.longpaths
- git remote show origin

---

**User**

error

---

**Cursor**

You’re ahead locally, but the remote already has commits (e.g., a README), so your push was rejected.

Pick ONE path:

Option A — Keep the remote’s history (recommended)
- git pull --rebase localworking main
- Resolve any conflicts if prompted, then: git add . && git rebase --continue
- git push -u localworking main

Option B — Overwrite the remote (only if you want your local to replace it)
- git push -u localworking main --force

Optional cleanup
- Rename remote to the conventional name:
  - git remote rename localworking origin
  - git push -u origin main

If the pull shows conflicts, paste the conflict summary and I’ll tell you exactly what to keep.

---

**User**

did it work

---

**Cursor**

Yes — the force push succeeded.

Quick verify
- git remote -v  (should show your GitHub URL)
- git log -1 --oneline  (top commit is now on GitHub)
- Open the repo URL to confirm files are there.

Optional cleanup
- git remote rename localworking origin
- git push -u origin main

**User**

great. What is next on the todo

---

**Cursor**

- Next item: Add Downsell logic with payment plans and feature‑scaled offers.

Use this prompt for Codex:
Implement downsell mechanisms to save the sale when users decline a primary or upsell offer.

Scope
- Payment plans: configurable installments (half‑now/half‑later, 3‑pay, 6‑pay); auto-calc due‑today + schedule; persist choice with booking.
- Feature‑scaled offers: “lite” versions of services/bundles (reduced scope/features) with clear comparison; replace selection if accepted.
- Conditional credit: allow “buy single now, credit applied if upgrading to package later”; store and auto-apply credits on upgrade.
- Triggers: show one respectful downsell prompt after a decline or checkout hesitation; cap to one prompt per event.
- Admin: create/edit/activate downsell rules (payment plans, scaled offers, upgrade credit); simple eligibility toggles.
- Tracking: record which downsells were shown/accepted; reflect plan fees/discounts in totals; persist details with the booking snapshot.

Acceptance
- Only active, eligible downsells appear; max one prompt per decline event.
- Installments validate amounts, show schedule, and update totals correctly.
- Scaled offer comparison is clear; accepting replaces original and updates totals.
- Upgrade credits are stored and automatically applied later.
- No regressions to products, bundles/BXGY, upsells, or booking flows.

**User**

I have just thought. I have a feature called Clinic Sync, where the app scrapes the clinics website to get their packages and stores them. Can we make sure that they are stored as 'prodcuts' so that they fit into this workflow and all the todo's we;ve done and are yet to do?

The agent has finsihed that step and needs the next prompt

---

**Cursor**

I’ll mark the Clinic Sync-to-products integration as completed and move on to the next highest‑impact item: credits/refund-as-credit workflows.

- Clinic Sync now maps scraped packages into Products. I’ve queued the next task: credits/refund-as-credit workflows.

### Prompt for Codex — Credits and Refund-as-Clinic-Credit workflows
Implement account credits that can be issued, stored, applied, and audited across the app.

Scope
- Issue credits: grant credits manually (admin) and programmatically (e.g., challenge refunds, win‑back, upgrade credit on package purchase), with reason codes.
- Store/apply: persist per‑customer credit balance; auto‑apply at checkout with clear line item; allow toggle to save credit for later.
- Partial/remaining: support partial application; show remaining balance post‑purchase.
- Expiration and limits: optional expiry date, max per order, and allowed categories (e.g., services only).
- Refund-as-credit: convert refunds to store credit instead of cash; show confirmation and rationale; record linkage to original order.
- Records: ledger of credit events (issued, applied, expired, revoked) with timestamps and user/action metadata.
- Admin UI: list/search credit balances, view ledger per customer, issue/adjust/revoke; basic validation and error messages.
- Booking snapshot: persist applied credit amount and resulting totals with the order/appointment.

Acceptance
- Credits persist and reconcile correctly; totals reflect applied credit; remaining balance accurate.
- Refund-as-credit path works end‑to‑end and logs to the ledger.
- Eligibility rules (expiry, category, max per order) enforced.
- No regressions to products, bundles/BXGY, upsells, downsells, or booking flows.

**User**

no unmark clinic sync - you misunderstood - I dint see that that was on the todo already - it hasnt been done. it did the downsell I mean, it hasnt mapped Map Clinic Sync scraped packages into Products catalog with categories. I repeat, it has NOT Map Clinic Sync scraped packages into Products catalog with categories yet

with this in mind, please correct the todo and give me the next prompt please. Sorry for the confusion.

---

**Cursor**

I’m updating the TODOs to correct Clinic Sync’s status and set it as the next in-progress task, then I’ll provide a concise, outcome-focused prompt for Codex.

- Corrected: Clinic Sync mapping is now in progress; credits are paused.

### Prompt for Codex — Map Clinic Sync scraped packages into Products
Integrate Clinic Sync so that scraped services/packages are created/updated as Products and used across the existing monetization flows.

Scope
- On Clinic Sync completion, upsert Products from scraped items (name, description, price £GBP, category = service or bundle).
- Handle duplicates by stable keys (e.g., name+price); update existing records; mark inactive if removed on re-sync.
- Normalize currency and store numeric price; ignore items without a valid price.
- Persist imported Products so they appear in admin catalog, bundles/BXGY, upsell rules, booking add-ons, and totals.
- Provide a simple review screen: show new/updated/inactive items and allow admin to approve before activation.
- Log import summary (counts of created/updated/inactivated) and surface errors gracefully.

Acceptance
- After a sync, new/updated products are available in the catalog and selectable in booking/upsell/bundle flows.
- No duplicates; pricing is correct in £; inactive items no longer show in selection.
- A review/approve step exists; changes persist after reload.
